# vulnerability_scanner
A vulnerability scanner for C/C++ programs.

# How it works
This is a simple vulnerability scanner for C/C++ programs. It scans for vulnerable C string functions in the source code file 
supplied to it from the command line. It then reads it line by line looking for vulnerable string functions including memory leaks.

# Compile using GCC
*gcc vuln_checker.c utils.c -o vuln_checker.o*

# Run
*./vuln_checker.o <c_source_code_file>*
